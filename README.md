# Analysing-airstrike

Birdstrikes, also known as birdâ€“aircraft collisions or bird hits, are incidents in which birds collide with aircraft, potentially causing damage to the aircraft and posing a safety hazard to aviation. These collisions can result in significant financial losses due to repairs, maintenance, and flight cancellations. The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assess the likelihood of birdstrike airstrikes in specific geographical areas, based on historical data and advanced data analysis techniques.

#About
Birdstrikes are a serious concern for the aviation industry. They can lead to engine failure, windshield damage, and other critical situations that endanger both passengers and crew. As air traffic continues to grow, the likelihood of birdstrikes also increases, making it imperative to develop effective strategies to mitigate the risk.

The project employs advanced machine learning techniques and data analysis to create a model that can forecast the probability of birdstrikes occurring in specific geographic areas, considering various factors that contribute to such incidents. The model leverages historical data on birdstrikes, flight patterns, bird migration routes, weather conditions, and other relevant variables.
